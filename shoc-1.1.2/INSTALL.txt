Scalable HeterOgeneous Computing (SHOC) Benchmark Suite: Installation

Note: The SHOC user manual in the doc directory contains more complete 
information about configuring, building, and using the SHOC Benchmark Suite.

0. Ensure you have a working OpenCL implementation and, if CUDA support
   is desired, CUDA version 3.1 or later installed.

1. Change to the root directory of the SHOC source distribution.  We'll call
   this directory $SHOC_ROOT in the following steps.

2. If you want to build SHOC with CUDA support, adjust your PATH environment
   variable so that the CUDA nvcc command can be found.

3. Configure the benchmark suite.  For some systems 'sh ./configure'
   is sufficient.  On other systems, you may need to extend CPPFLAGS
   and/or LDFLAGS so that OpenCL headers and libraries can be found by
   configure.  For example,

     sh ./configure CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/cuda/include"

   Other commonly-needed configuration switches are
   --with-mpi-includes and --with-mpi-libraries so that the SHOC build
   system can find MPI headers and libraries.  The following example
   explicitly enables both OpenCL and MPI (assuming that the variables
   $CUDA3_1_ROOT and $MPI_ROOT have been set appropriately; the MPI
   libraries required may vary between MPI implementations):

     sh ./configure --with-opencl CPPFLAGS="-I$CUDA3_1_ROOT/include" \
      --with-mpi --with-mpi-includes="-I$MPI_ROOT/include" \
      --with-mpi-libraries="-L$MPI_ROOT/lib -lmpi -lmpi_cxx" 

   See 'sh ./configure --help' and the user's guide for more information 
   on configuring SHOC using the autoconf-generated configure script.

4. Build the benchmark programs with 
      $ cd $SHOC_ROOT; make
    Program executables will be left in the $SHOC_ROOT/bin directory. The
    bin directory contains subdirectories for different versions of the
    benchmarks.  TP - True Parallel, EP - Embarrassingly Parallel

5. Run single-device tests with something like
      $ $SHOC_ROOT/bin/Serial/OpenCL/Sort
   Run MPI-based multi-device tests with something like
      $ mpirun -np 8 $SHOC_ROOT/bin/EP/OpenCL/Sort
   Use 1 MPI rank per device.

   Alternatively, the tools folder contains scripts to run the full
   suite at once. The script depends on MPI being in your current path,
   so be sure to set environment variables appropriately. Example for
   a bash shell.
      $ export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/mpi/bin/dir
      $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/path/to/mpi/lib/dir

   Run specify the size (1-4) and whether to use the CUDA or OpenCL versions
   of the benchmarks.  For cuda:
      $ cd $SHOC_ROOT/tools
      $ perl driver.pl -s 2 -cuda
   
   or the OpenCL version with:
      $ cd $SHOC_ROOT/tools
      $ perl driver.pl -s 2 -opencl
      
   To run the parallel versions of the benchmarks, supply the script with the 
   number of nodes and the number of devices per node.  For example, for a 4 
   node cluster with 2 devices per node, size 1 benchmark problems, CUDA 
   versions, use:
      $ cd $SHOC_ROOT/tools
      $ perl driver.pl -n 4 -d 2 -s 1 -cuda
   
   Both scripts will output benchmarks results to a file in comma separated 
   value format to results.csv
      
See the SHOC user manual and README.txt for more information.
